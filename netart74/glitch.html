  <h2>Text Glitch</h2>
  <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="1-2.jpg" alt="Text Glitch">
  <p>The original photo is a part of a tv series (A Little Reunion) poster, and I edited this photo by text tool. Also, I used mask to cover parents' faces, copied one more picture and changed to hard mix mode as the cover of it through Photoshop.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Audacity Glitch</h2>
  <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="2-3.jpg" alt="Audacity Glitch">
  <p>This is the second poster of the same tv series. I edited it in Audacity and added echo, fade in, invert, and repeat effects on it. And then working on Photoshop, I also used the same method as the first one I did.<br><br>What I want to say by these pictures is parents always want their children to become "better", and they teach and form the kids by their own images.</p>
