  <p>The original photo is a part of a tv series (A Little Reunion) poster, and I edited this photo by text tool. Also, I used mask to cover parents' faces, copied one more picture and changed to hard mix mode as the cover of it through Photoshop.</p>

  <p>I built this website to record the little stories between me and my little family member, Teemo. He is two years old now, and he is cute haha. At the very first beginning, I wanted to make a website about dog people and cat people. But later, I changed my idea and remake the whole thing.  After finishing this website, I feel satisfied because the memories I went through with Teemo are interesting and lovely. I wish I can live with him as long as possible, I can't imagine the day without him in the future.</p>
