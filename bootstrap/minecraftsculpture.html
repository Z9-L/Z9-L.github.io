  <p>My project is a little model of Ironman. I was interested in ACG culture since I was in middle school, and Ironman is my favorite character in the Western ACG culture. I had 2 versions of my project because I found that the first version (the right one) lost many details and I couldn't tell that was an Ironman model. Thus, I made the second version (the left one) which was easier to recognize.</p>
